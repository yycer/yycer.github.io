excerpt: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

## 题目描述  

> Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.  
> Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.  
> You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).  

有一个数组，其中索引代表是哪一天，值代表当天的股票价格，求其最大的利润。  

举两个例子：  


``` java
Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.

Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

## `解法1`  

我的想法是这样的：  

首先，从`第二个数值`开始遍历，若`其大于前一个数值`，则累加其差，否则跳过。  


``` java
@Test
public void question122(){
    int[] prices = {7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4};
    int ret = ArrayProblems.p122(prices);
    Assert.assertEquals(ret, 7);
}

public class ArrayProblems {
    public static int p122(int[] prices) {
        int amount = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]){
                amount += (prices[i] - prices[i - 1]);
            }
        }
        return amount;
    }
}
```

## `优化1`  

翻了下讨论区，有种更简洁的写法：  

``` java
public class ArrayProblems {
    public static int p122(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
            profit += Math.max(0, prices[i] - prices[i - 1]);
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
```

    
## `解法2`  

再来看一种解法，如下图所示：

``` java
public static int p122UsingResetPoint(int[] prices){
    if(prices.length == 0) return 0;
    int profit = 0, low = prices[0], max = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++){
        if(prices[i] < prices[i - 1]){
            //reset point
            profit += max;
            max = 0;
            low = prices[i];
        }else {
            max = Math.max(max, prices[i] - low);
        }
    }
    profit += max;
    return profit;
}
```
