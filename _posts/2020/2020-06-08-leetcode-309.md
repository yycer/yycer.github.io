## 问题描述  

> Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.  

> Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:  

> You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)  

在一段时间内计算股票的最大收益，每次出售股票后`隔天`才能买入。  



举个例子：  

``` java
Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3 
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
```

来看下实现：  


``` java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int len = prices.length;
        if (len < 2) return 0;
        int[] hold   = new int[len];
        int[] unHold = new int[len];

        hold[0] = -prices[0];
        hold[1] = -Math.min(prices[0], prices[1]);
        unHold[1] = Math.max(0, hold[0] + prices[1]);

        for (int i = 2; i < len; i++){
            hold[i]   = Math.max(hold[i - 1], unHold[i - 2] - prices[i]);
            unHold[i] = Math.max(unHold[i - 1], hold[i - 1] + prices[i]);
        }

        return unHold[len - 1];
    }
}
```
