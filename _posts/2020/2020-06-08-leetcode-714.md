excerpt: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee
---

## 问题描述  

> Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i; and a non-negative integer fee representing a transaction fee.  

> You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)  

> Return the maximum profit you can make.  

计算一段时间内的股票最大收益，交易次数不限，但是每次交易需要交一定的`手续费`。  

举个例子：  

``` java
Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
Buying at prices[0] = 1
Selling at prices[3] = 8
Buying at prices[4] = 4
Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
```

此题和 [ 股票冷冻期 ](http://yaoyichen.cn/algorithm/2020/06/08/leetcode-309.html){:target="_blank"}类似，借助`hold`与`unhold`两个数组：

需要注意一点，也就是手续费什么时候交。  

有两种选择，买股票或卖股票时，我选择卖时交。  

来看下实现：  


``` java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices, int fee) {
        int len = prices.length;
        if (len == 0) return 0;
        int[] hold   = new int[len];
        int[] unhold = new int[len];
        hold[0] = -prices[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < len; i++){
            int cur = prices[i];
            hold[i]   = Math.max(hold[i - 1], unhold[i - 1] - cur);
            unhold[i] = Math.max(unhold[i - 1], hold[i - 1] + cur - fee);
        }

        return unhold[len - 1];
    }
}
```
