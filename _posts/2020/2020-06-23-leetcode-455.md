## 问题描述  

> Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.  

你有一些饼干可以分给你的孩子们，每个孩子只能得到一块饼干，并且孩子`i`只有被分配到`g[i]`块饼干后才会得到满足，求最多可以使几个孩子满足。  

> Note:  
You may assume the greed factor is always positive.  
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.  

假设所有的贪婪因子都是正整数。  

举个例子：  

``` java
Example 1:
Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.

Example 2:
Input: [1,2], [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.
```


## 解法1  

我的思路是这样的：  

首先，分别对两个数组进行升序排序，时间复杂度为`nlog(n)`。  

然后，分别从两个数组的第一元素开始遍历并比较，  

如果，当前饼干能令该孩子满足，则两个指针均`+1`，并且`ans++`。  

否则，仅指向饼干的指针`+1`，直至任意一个数组走到尽头。  


来看下实现：  


``` java
class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        
        int ans  = 0;
        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);
        
        int lenG = g.length;
        int lenS = s.length;
        int gLo  = 0;
        int sLo  = 0;
        
        while (gLo < lenG && sLo < lenS){
            if (s[sLo] >= g[gLo]){
                gLo++;
                ans++;
            }
            sLo++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
