excerpt: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II
---

## 问题描述  

> Say you have an array prices for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.  

> Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).  

> Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).  

计算某段时间内可获得的最大股票利润，交易次数不限。  


举个例子：  

``` java
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```


## 解法1  


Thanks [@summerrainet2008](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/discuss/39420/Three-lines-in-C%2B%2B-with-explanation){:target="_blank"}  

这个公式非常惊艳：  

`d - a = (d - c) + (c - b) + (b - a)`  

`z = x - y`，若`z < 0`, 则返回`0`，否则返回`z`。  


来看下示意图：

``` java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int len = prices.length;
        int ans = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < len; i++){
            ans += Math.max(0, prices[i] - prices[i - 1]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

`Enjoy it ! `

不过还是有点瑕疵，如果`prices = [1, 2, 3, 4]`。  

虽然返回的结果是`3`，但是对于同一天的股票，它既买了又卖了。
