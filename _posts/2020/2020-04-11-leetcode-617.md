## 题目描述  

> Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.  
> You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.  

合并两棵二叉树，规则如下：  

若两个节点均有值，则累加，  
若只有一个节点有值，那就是这个节点。  




## 解法1  

Thanks [@shawngao and @littleshortfairy](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-binary-trees/discuss/104299/Java-Solution-6-lines-Tree-Traversal){:target="_blank"}  

关键在于非空判断与新建节点。  


![](https://yyc-images.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/leetcode_617.png)  


``` java
public TreeNode mergeTrees(TreeNode t1, TreeNode t2) {
    if (t1 == null) return t2;
    if (t2 == null) return t1;
    TreeNode newNode = new TreeNode(t1.val + t2.val);
    newNode.left  = mergeTrees(t1.left,  t2.left);
    newNode.right = mergeTrees(t1.right, t2.right);
    return newNode;
}
```

最后强调一点，一旦执行到新建节点位置[第三行]，说明什么？  

`t1`和`t2`两个节点都有值！
