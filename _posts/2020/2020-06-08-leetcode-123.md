## 问题描述  

> Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.  

> Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.  

> Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).  

计算一段时间内的股票最大收益，最多只能进行`两次`交易。  


举个例子：  

``` java
Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

来看下实现：  


``` java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int b1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, s1 = 0;
        int b2 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, s2 = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++){
            int cur = prices[i];
            b1 = Math.max(b1, -cur);
            s1 = Math.max(s1, b1 + cur);
            b2 = Math.max(b2, s1 - cur);
            s2 = Math.max(s2, b2 + cur);
        }
        return s2;
    }
}
```
