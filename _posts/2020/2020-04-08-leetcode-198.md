## 题目描述  

> You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.  

> Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.  

假设有一个小偷要在一条街上作案，每间房间内都有一定的现金，但是不能偷相邻两间房间内的现金，不然会触发安全警报，请问小偷最多可以成功偷多少现金？  

举个例子：

``` java
Input: [2,1,1,2]
Output: 4
```

核心思想在于这个公式： 

`rob(i) = Math.max(rob(i - 2) + nums[i], rob(i - 1));`

``` java
public int rob(int[] nums) {
    if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return 0;
    int a = 0, b = 0;
    for (int n: nums){
        int cur = Math.max(a + n, b);
        a = b;
        b = cur;
    }
    return b;
}
```
